# Create art like Piet Mondrian

Inspired by the artist [Piet Mondrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian) I've created a tool to allow you to create your own artwork. You can drag the borders for resizing, add or remove squares and colour in squares only using the Mondrian's colour scheme.

# Guide

Move the black dividers to resize the shapes. To make the painting your own use the menu on the right to select other features such as delete, divide horizontal or vertical. 

Once you have completed your design you can press the "paint" button and you'll be re-directed to a new page with your artwork. That page is unique to your artwork, so you can send that link to anyone and they will see the same. 

**warning** Your artwork is stored in the link so the more changes you make the longer the link!

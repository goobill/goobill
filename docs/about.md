## Howdy

I am a Bouldering Frisbee player who codes for fun and can't drive so insists on cycling.

During the day I am a Software Engineer gone Data Scientist gone what ever - jack of all trades, master of none.

## About

Goobill originated from my friends not understanding what I do for a living and just joked I'll take over Google some day then rename it to Goobill. So I created this site in preparation. In all seriousness, I built this website as a joke but it then evolved to a space to put my mini projects I had completed, it was also a great way to not use a web framework and just make a static website.

## Disclaimer

I have written some blog pages and docs for my projects, however, please don't expected consistency in posts or how I write them. These pages are a space for me to practice writing not deliver high quality content to the world.
